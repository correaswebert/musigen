What is MusiGen?
----------------

MusiGen is a music co-production system. 

Human and artificial intelligence create music in a symbiotic fashion. Using genetic algorithms, new patterns are created from the existing data. The human will rate the generated musical piece, using which the algorithm will create new combinations.


Installation
------------

MusiGen can be installed using `pipenv`

```
pipenv install --dev
```

*I have not yet made a user package. Some dev dependencies need to be installed for now.*


Usage
-----

```
pipenv run python main.py
```
